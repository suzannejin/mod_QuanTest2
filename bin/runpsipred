# This is a simple script which will carry out all of the basic steps
# required to make a PSIPRED prediction. Note that it assumes that the
# following programs are in the appropriate directories:
# psipred - PSIPRED V4 program
# psipass2 - PSIPRED V4 program
#
# Usage: tcsh runpsipred <MTX file>

# NOTE: Script modified to be more cluster friendly (DTJ April 2008)
# and modified to directly use MTX file generated from MSA (SJ March 2020)

# Where the PSIPRED V4 programs have been installed
set execdir = /usr/src/app/psipred/bin

# Where the PSIPRED V4 data files have been installed
